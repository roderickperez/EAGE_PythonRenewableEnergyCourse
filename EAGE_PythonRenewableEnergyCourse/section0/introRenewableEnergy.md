# Introduction to Renewable Energies

## Energy

Energy can be described using various equations and principles that highlight its different forms and conservation laws. Key energy-related equations include:

- **Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence**: The famous equation $E = mc^2$, proposed by Albert Einstein in the theory of special relativity, establishes a relationship between mass and energy. It suggests that a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy.

- **Energy Conservation Principle**: The principle of conservation of energy is expressed by the equation $\Delta E_{system} + \Delta E_{surroundings} = 0$. This equation states that the total energy in a closed system remains constant, although it can be transferred between the system and its surroundings.

- **Kinetic Energy Equation**: Kinetic energy ($E_k$) can be calculated using the formula $E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of an object and $v$ is its velocity. This equation shows that the energy of motion is directly proportional to the mass and the square of the velocity of the object.

- **Total Mechanical Energy**: The total mechanical energy in a system, which is the sum of kinetic energy ($K$) and potential energy ($U$), is conserved in the absence of external forces. This is expressed as $K_0 + U_0 = K + U$ or $\Delta K + \Delta U = 0$, where the subscript $0$ denotes initial values.

Common symbols for energy include $E$, and it is typically measured in joules (J) in the SI system. Other units include kilowatt-hours (kW⋅h), British Thermal Units (BTU), calories, electron volts (eV), ergs, and foot-pounds. In SI base units, energy is represented as $J = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$.

## Power: The Rate of Energy Use

Power is the rate at which energy is consumed or work is performed. It quantifies how quickly energy is used or transferred. The relationship between energy and power can be defined as:

- **Power Equation**: Power ($P$) is calculated by dividing energy by time, or $P = \frac{E}{t}$. This equation shows that one watt (W) is equivalent to one joule of energy expended per second.

- **Electrical Power**: In electrical systems, the power transferred between energy stores is given by $P = I \times V$, where $I$ represents the current and $V$ represents the potential difference (voltage).

- **Standard Metric Unit of Power**: The standard metric unit of power is the Watt. As implied by the equation for power, a unit of power is equivalent to a unit of work divided by a unit of time. Thus, a Watt is equivalent to a Joule per second ($\text{W} = \frac{J}{s}$). For historical reasons, the horsepower is occasionally used to describe the power delivered by a machine. One horsepower is equivalent to approximately 750 Watts.

Common symbols for power include $P$, with the SI unit being the watt (W). In SI base units, power is expressed as $W = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$.

## Energy Markets

### World Energy Consumption
What is global energy consumption? Global energy consumption is the total amount of energy used on the planet to meet human needs. This energy mainly comes from non-renewable or fossil sources, such as oil, coal, or natural gas. These sources have a high environmental and social impact, contributing to climate change, air and water pollution, and geopolitical conflicts.

\[
P = \frac{W}{t}
\]
Where:
- $P$ is power,
- $W$ is work done,
- $t$ is time.

### World Energy Renewable Adoption
In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which is consistent with enacted energy policies and a pragmatic view of proposed policies, worldwide energy supply is expected to grow by approximately 21% between 2019 and 2050. While there is a decline in supply for coal in this scenario, between 2019 and 2050, oil and natural gas are expected to grow by 6% and 24%, respectively, and account for approximately 50% of the energy mix in 2050.

## Renewable Energies
Renewable energies are energy sources based on the use of the sun, wind, water, or biomass. They do not use fossil fuels, unlike conventional energies, but resources that can be renewed indefinitely.

### Hydroelectric Energy
Hydroelectric energy is generated by the movement of water through turbines. This energy is renewable and produces no direct emissions.

### Eolic Energy
Eolic energy, or wind energy, harnesses the power of wind to generate electricity using wind turbines.

### Solar Energy
Solar energy captures sunlight to generate electricity or heat. It includes technologies like photovoltaic solar panels and concentrated solar power systems.

### Geothermal Energy
Geothermal energy utilizes heat from within the Earth to generate electricity or provide direct heating.

\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]
Where:
- $Q$ is the heat added,
- $m$ is the mass,
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity,
- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

## Energy Storage
Energy storage is a process of saving energy in a system or device for later use. Different types of energy storage systems exist, including lithium batteries, pumped hydro storage, compressed air, or hydrogen storage.

### Pumped Hydro
Flowing water is moved downhill through turbines, which rotate to generate power. The water can then be pumped back uphill to be reused when needed.

### Solar Thermal
Solar thermal systems use the sun to generate and store electricity by using mirrors, salt, and steam. The mirrors focus sunlight into a tower that heats salt, which creates steam to run turbines that generate electricity.

### Batteries
When connected to renewable sources like solar and wind, batteries store excess energy. This energy can then be used later when needed, such as at night when the sun is no longer shining.

## Current Energy Context
In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), consistent with enacted energy policies and a pragmatic view of proposed policies, worldwide energy supply is expected to grow by approximately 21% between 2019 and 2050. Although coal supply is expected to decline during this period, oil and natural gas are anticipated to grow by 6% and 24%, respectively, accounting for approximately 50% of the energy mix by 2050.
