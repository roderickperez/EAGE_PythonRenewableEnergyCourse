# Introduction to Programming

**Objetives**
* Provide an *overview* of basic computational practices, and why they should learn them.

## Program

An important part of this course is aimed at developing **basic** programming skills. In future sections, and with practice, we will develop these skills in *Baby steps*. At the end of this course (probaly) you will not have the programming skills of a Computer engineer (don't worry, neither am I), but my wish is that you will be less afraid to read and write some code on your own.

A question that I am very frequently asked is: "I am a Geoscientist. Is it necessary to learn to program?" and my answer is **YES**. Currently, there is a trend in the job market for geoscientists, where employers are looking for comprehensive profiles that allow more quantitative analysis, as well as the candidate having (basic) programming skills, as well as an understanding of the fundamentals of the algorithms that are applied. Additionally, one of the advantages of increasing your competitiveness in the labor market will also allow you to be able to go beyond the software that you currently have in your organization, as well as go further and develop your own algorithms that allow you to stand out as a professional. best professional.

It is becoming more common than open source (ArcGIS, QGIS, ParaView, Google Earth) and commercial sofware in the field of geoscience (ArcGIS, Hampton & Russell, Petrel, OpendTect, PaleoScan, among others) include Python modules, in which users can apply their own algorithms and expand the possibilities of the software. When you leave this course you may not be a *super star*, but you will learn to take your first steps.

Before start to dive into a specific programming languages (such as Python) we need to know the concepts and skills necessary to be able to transmit the instructions so that the system (computer) understands them and can generate the results we expect.

In general, there are 4 things that are essential to be able to develop our computational skills:

* Patience
* Dedication
* Time
* Consistency

## What is a Computer?
In general, we can describe a *computer* as a electronic device (machine) that **stores** and **manipulates** information, through the instructions given by a user. We call the *electronic* part of a computer **hardware**, and the *programs* part **software**.

## What is a Program?

When we program, what we are doing is giving a series of instructions and commands, in an orderly and organized way, to said machine, which are going to be transformed into binary language (0's and 1's) and this returns the result of the operations carried out.

Usually, the program is compiled by the programmer before it can be executed. Sometimes however programs are interpreted by another program.

## Why Program?

In general, programming is the same as being able to **solve problems**.

* Fun
* Divide complex problems into simpler solutions
* Develop problem solving strategy
* Try your own solutions

## Programming Strategy (Scientific Method)
1. Define a **problem**
2. Collect information
3. Hypothesis
4. Test hypothesis
5. Analyze the data
6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve to test the hypothesis (in step 3)
7. Publish results
8. Repeat results
