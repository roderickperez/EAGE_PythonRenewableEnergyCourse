# Advanced Linear Regression Algorithms

As we descrived in the previous section, linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to predict the value of a dependent variable given the values of the independent variables. However, me might add a regularization term to the cost function to avoid overfitting.

Regularization is 

* Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is a variation of linear regression with L1 regularization.



* Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is a variation of linear regression with L2 regularization.
