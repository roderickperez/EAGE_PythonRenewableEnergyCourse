# SQL Basics


## SQL

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed for managing and interacting with databases. SQL commands serve as the instructions to execute various operations, such as querying data, performing tasks, and executing functions within the database.

These commands allow you to perform actions like searching the database, creating and modifying tables, inserting or updating data, and even deleting tables.

Below is an essential list of basic SQL commands, often referred to as clauses, that are fundamental for anyone working with SQL.
