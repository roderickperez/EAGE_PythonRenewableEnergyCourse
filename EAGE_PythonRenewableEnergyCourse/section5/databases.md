# Databases

A database is a structured collection of information that is stored electronically and managed by a database management system (DBMS). Databases make it easy to store, organize, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data efficiently. They are designed to support various types of data, from text and numbers to complex files, enabling users to search for, update, or delete data as needed.

For example, consider a database used to store energy data for renewable energy sources. This database might contain information on the amount of energy generated by different renewable sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, across various countries and over specific periods of time. 

A simple table in this database could look like this:

| Country      | Energy Source | Date       | Energy Generated (MWh) |
|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|
| Germany      | Wind          | 2024-01-01 | 10,000                 |
| Germany      | Solar         | 2024-01-01 | 5,500                  |
| USA          | Hydropower    | 2024-01-01 | 12,000                 |
| Brazil       | Wind          | 2024-01-01 | 8,000                  |

In this example, the database organizes information about energy generation in terms of countries, energy sources, dates, and the amount of energy produced. With this database, you could run SQL queries to find trends, compare energy production between countries, or analyze the output of different renewable sources over time.

For instance, if you wanted to know how much wind energy Germany generated on a particular day, you could query the database to quickly retrieve that specific information.


# Types of Databases

Databases come in various forms, each designed to handle specific types of data and relationships. Below is an overview of several common types of databases, along with their advantages, disadvantages, and examples of software or services.
