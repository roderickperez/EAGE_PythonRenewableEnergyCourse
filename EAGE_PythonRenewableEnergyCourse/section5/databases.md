# Databases

A database is a structured collection of information that is stored electronically and managed by a database management system (DBMS). Databases make it easy to store, organize, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data efficiently. They are designed to support various types of data, from text and numbers to complex files, enabling users to search for, update, or delete data as needed.

For example, consider a database used to store energy data for renewable energy sources. This database might contain information on the amount of energy generated by different renewable sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, across various countries and over specific periods of time. 

A simple table in this database could look like this:

| Country      | Energy Source | Date       | Energy Generated (MWh) |
|--------------|---------------|------------|------------------------|
| Germany      | Wind          | 2024-01-01 | 10,000                 |
| Germany      | Solar         | 2024-01-01 | 5,500                  |
| USA          | Hydropower    | 2024-01-01 | 12,000                 |
| Brazil       | Wind          | 2024-01-01 | 8,000                  |

In this example, the database organizes information about energy generation in terms of countries, energy sources, dates, and the amount of energy produced. With this database, you could run SQL queries to find trends, compare energy production between countries, or analyze the output of different renewable sources over time.

For instance, if you wanted to know how much wind energy Germany generated on a particular day, you could query the database to quickly retrieve that specific information.


# Types of Databases

Databases come in various forms, each designed to handle specific types of data and relationships. Below is an overview of several common types of databases, along with their advantages, disadvantages, and examples of software or services.

## 1. Hierarchical Databases

Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure, with parent-child relationships between records. Each parent can have multiple children, but each child only has one parent, making it similar to a hierarchy.

**Advantages:**
- Fast data access for hierarchical relationships
- Simplicity in representing one-to-many relationships

**Disadvantages:**
- Difficult to scale or modify
- Limited flexibility in querying due to rigid structure

**Example:** IBM Information Management System (IMS)

:alt: hierarchicalDatabase
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 800px
:align: center
```

## 2. Network Databases

Network databases extend hierarchical models by allowing each child to have multiple parents, forming a complex web of relationships. This design supports more complex data interactions.

**Advantages:**
- Efficient for many-to-many relationships
- Faster access in certain complex datasets

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex design and maintenance
- Structure changes are challenging

**Example:** Integrated Data Store (IDS)

     Departments      Clubs
         |              |
    -------------------------
    |          |           |
Students   Faculty      Resources

## 3. Object-Oriented Databases

Object-oriented databases store data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Data and its related methods are bundled together, making it easier to work with complex datasets.

**Advantages:**
- Handles complex data types (e.g., images, videos)
- Reduces workload by reusing objects

**Disadvantages:**
- Steeper learning curve
- Limited support for complex queries

**Example:** db4o (Database for Objects)

 Person
  | livesAt()
Address
  | belongsTo()
Company

---

## 4. Relational Databases

Relational databases organize data into tables, with rows and columns representing different records and fields. Data is linked through keys (primary and foreign keys), making this the most popular database model.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to use and widely adopted
- Scalable and supports complex queries using SQL

**Disadvantages:**
- Difficult to handle large, unstructured data
- Requires strict schema design

**Example:** MySQL, PostgreSQL

Table 1: Students             Table 2: Courses
-----------------             -----------------
ID   | Name                   Course_ID | Name
-----------------             -----------------
101  | Alice                  201       | Math
102  | Bob                    202       | Science

Foreign Key: Student_ID in Course Table

---

## 5. Cloud Databases

Cloud databases store data on cloud computing platforms, offering flexibility and scalability. They can be accessed from anywhere and often offer pay-as-you-go models.

**Advantages:**
- Scalable and cost-efficient
- Accessible globally via the internet

**Disadvantages:**
- Dependent on internet connectivity
- Potential data security concerns

**Example:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), SupaBase

[User] --> [Cloud Platform] --> [Database Service]
             (AWS, GCP, etc.)

---

## 6. Centralized Databases

In centralized databases, data is stored and maintained at a single location. All users and applications access this central repository, providing better control and security.

**Advantages:**
- High data security
- Reduced data redundancy

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow access times due to a single point of data storage
- Difficult to update and modify

**Example:** Microsoft SQL Server

[User] --> [Cloud Platform] --> [Database Service]
             (AWS, GCP, etc.)

---

## 7. Operational Databases

Operational databases are used for managing dynamic data in real time, typically for daily business operations. They are often optimized for transaction processing.

**Advantages:**
- Fast data access and updates
- Real-time data processing

**Disadvantages:**
- Can become complex to manage with large datasets
- Requires constant maintenance

**Example:** Oracle Database

  Users --> [ Operational Database ]
                    |
            Real-time Transactions

---

## 8. NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases offer flexibility in storing unstructured data and allow horizontal scaling across clusters. They do not rely on traditional table structures.

**Advantages:**
- High scalability and availability
- Flexible data models

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited query capabilities compared to SQL
- Backup and security can be challenging

**Example:** MongoDB, Cassandra

Documents --> [ NoSQL Database ] --> Flexible Data Models
  (Unstructured Data)
